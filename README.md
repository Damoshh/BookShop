The `BookShop` repository by Damoshh is a web-based application designed to facilitate online book shopping. It comprises a frontend developed in JavaScript and CSS, and a backend implemented in Java. The repository includes several CSV files (`admins.csv`, `books.csv`, `cartItems.csv`, `orders.csv`, `users.csv`) that likely serve as data storage for the application's various components.

**Key Features:**

- **User Management:** Handles user information, including administrative roles, as indicated by `admins.csv` and `users.csv`.

- **Book Catalog:** Manages a collection of books available for purchase, detailed in `books.csv`.

- **Shopping Cart:** Allows users to add items to a cart, with details stored in `cartItems.csv`.

- **Order Processing:** Facilitates order placement and tracking, with records maintained in `orders.csv`.

**Installation and Setup:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Damoshh/BookShop.git
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**

   - Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory and build the project using your preferred Java build tool.

3. **Frontend Setup:**

   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
   - Open the HTML files in your preferred web browser to access the application's interface.

**Usage:**

Once the backend is running and the frontend is accessible through your web browser, you can interact with the application to browse books, add them to your cart, and proceed with orders.
